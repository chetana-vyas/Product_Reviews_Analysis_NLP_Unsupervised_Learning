# Project Proposal

## Product Reviews Analysis

## Purpose:
It is important to understand what customer thinks about a product or specific brand.

## Goal:
To understand the following about Product Reviews - what are most frequently used words, distribution of the length of the reviews, understanding fake reviews, spelling errors, predicting product rating using the reviews, etc. 

## Data Description:

• [kaggle dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datafiniti/grammar-and-online-product-reviews)

## Algorithms:
I will use NLP and Classification Algorithms to analyze the customer reviews.

## Tools:

Python packages for building the model –
1.	Scikit-learn, NLTK - NLP and Classification
2.	Pandas – manipulating and working on data frames
3.	NumPy – working with arrays
4.	matplotlib, seaborn, and Tableau – data visualization
	
## MVP Goal:
Build a basic NLP Model to deeply help us understand the customer reviews beyond just the rating value.
